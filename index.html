        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm 14 years old student from Kazakhstan.And I want to be <span class="span">an aspiring software engineer and be part of UWC ISAK Japan family.</span> From early childhood, I was very curious and wise. I was always interested in things that others found uninteresting or boring. I always loved going to school and acquiring new, interesting, and unusual knowledge. And now, this international school is my chance to show myself to the world and help to other talented teenagers achieve something greater and share it with the world.</p>

        <h2>Skills & Interests</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> <span class="span">IT sphere</span>. I love technology, inventions, machines, and so on. I even remember my mother telling me as a child that I would become a great scientist and inventor because I loved building Lego. And now I want to be one, the greatest and best programmer and scientist of our time, and I also want to make my mother proud. I've recently learned HTML/CSS, and that's what the site is all about. More to come, I'll soon be learning JS and Python. After completing my studies at your school, I intend to enroll in a technology and engineering university in Japan.</li>
            <br>
            <li><span class="span">Mathematics</span>. I've been interested in mathematics and astronomy since elementary school. Everyone laughed at me and said I was weird for loving math. But I ignored them and progressed. I participated in many international Olympiads, such as the Fibonacci Olympiad, the Bulgarian Olympiad, and others. Below is a link to photos of the medals I received in the olympiads.</li>
            <br>
            <li><span class="span">Tennis</span>. This is my favorite sport; I adore it with all my heart. I've spent half my life playing it, and it's worth it. I've learned a lot of good and useful skills during my time on the court. I'll give you a quick overview: First, mental health—you need to have a healthy mind to play this sport. Second, don't be afraid to make mistakes I advise all teenagers who are afraid to pursue their dreams or get into a certain field to know this and take advantage of it. And of course, I have medals for tennis, they'll also be linked below.</li>
            <br>
            <li><span class="span">Music</span>. Besides sports and studying, I'm also passionate about music and creativity. I really enjoy making beats and sharing them with the world. I create music in FL Studio editor. I already have several projects that I've created and published. I didn't take profit from them, but I worked hard because there are four children in my family, and our parents are trying to support for us and I want to help them with this. Just like the medals, I will leave a link to my work. I also want to ask UWC ISAK Japan to financially support me and my family, to help me realize my dream and goal.</li>

        <h2>My Future Goals</h2>
        <p>Since childhood, I have been fascinated by technology and creativity. Over time, this curiosity led me to study programming and start building my own websites.
           My goal is to become a skilled developer who creates innovative projects that make people’s lives easier and more meaningful.
           Studying in Japan will allow me to grow not only academically but also personally — learning from a culture that values discipline, respect, and innovation.</p>
           <br>
           <hr />
           <br>
           <p>And I’m applying for financial aid because I really want to study at UWC ISAK Japan. I want to learn, grow, and do something meaningful — not because of money, but because I believe in what this school stands for.</p>
